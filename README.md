Training examples
=================

To get the presentation running I've had to fire up a python web server:



Fire up python web server:
	module load python/ana
	cd bin
	run_server

Now run the presentation in the browser:
	firefox http://localhost:8000/training.slides.html

or use the script:
	run_slides

Note you may have to change the port if the server serves on a diffrent port from default.
